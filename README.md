# Sensor Collector

## Description

Sensor Collector is a microservice developed in Java with Spring Boot that receives sensor data through an HTTP API.
This data is processed and sent to a Kafka messaging system for further processing by other microservices, such as
sensor-monitor.

## Technologies Used

- Java 11 (or higher)
- Spring Boot
- Apache Kafka (for communication with other microservices)
- Log4j 2 (for logging)
- Maven (for dependency management)

## Architecture

The sensor-collector microservice acts as a receiver for sensor data. When a client sends an HTTP POST request with the
sensor data, the service validates the data and sends it to a Kafka topic for processing by other microservices.

The basic flow is:

1. Client sends sensor data via POST to the API.
2. Sensor Collector receives and validates the data.
3. Kafka is used to send the data to the corresponding topic.
4. Other microservices, like sensor-monitor, consume that data from Kafka for analysis or further processing.

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Java 11 (or higher)
- Apache Kafka installed and configured locally or on an accessible server
- Zookeeper (if running Kafka locally)
- Maven

## Installation and configuration

1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure Kafka: Open the src/main/resources/application.yml file and configure the Kafka connection details:

    ```yaml
    spring:
      kafka:
        bootstrap-servers: localhost:9092
        producer:
          key-serializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
          value-serializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
    ```

3. Build the project: Run the following command in the project root directory:

    ```shell
    mvn clean install
    ```

4. Run the project: Run the following command in the project root directory:

    ```shell
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Start Zookeeper (if running Kafka locally).
2. Start Kafka.
3. Start the sensor-collector microservice.
4. Send sensor data to the microservice.

## API

## Endpoint: Receive Sensor Data

- URL: /api/sensor
- Method: POST
- Description: Receives data from a sensor and sends it to Kafka.

### Request

- Body example:
    ```json
    {
        "sensorId": "sensor-1",
        "sensorType": "temperature",
        "sensorValue": 25.5,
        "sensorUnit": "C",
        "timestamp": "2021-08-01T12:00:00Z"
    }
    ```

### Response

- Response example:
    ```json
    {
        "message": "Data received successfully.",
        "data": {
          "sensorId": "123",
          "temperature": 70.5,
          "timestamp": "2023-09-21T10:15:30Z"
        } 
    }
    ```

## Scripts

With the following script, you can send sensor data to the `sensor-collector` microservice. Make sure the microservice is
running before executing the script, and ensure that the requests library is installed.

```python
import requests
import random
import time
from datetime import datetime

def generate_sensor_data():
    sensor_id = f"sensor-{random.randint(1000,5000)}"
    sensor_type = random.choice(["temperature", "humidity", "preassure"])
    sensor_value = round(random.uniform(1, 100), 2)
    sensor_unit = random.choice(["Â°C", "%", "hPa"])
    sensor_timestamp = datetime.now().isoformat()

    return {
            "sensorId": sensor_id,
            "sensorType": sensor_type,
            "sensorValue": sensor_value,
            "sensorUnit": sensor_unit,
            "sensorTimestamp": sensor_timestamp
     }


def main():
    url = "http://localhost:8080/sensor"


    while True:
        sensor_data = generate_sensor_data()

        try:
            response = requests.post(url, json=sensor_data)
            print(f"Message sent: {sensor_data}")
            print(f"Status code: {response.status_code}")
        except :
            print("Error sendig sensor data")

        time.sleep(3)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
